# untitled_chess_app
This is Python chess app using PyGame and the Python Chess Library to make simple chess app. In the future this app will also have online support with Python's threading and Socket libraries.

# Install
This project requires you to have Python Chess and PyGame installed to run. I will be working on making a proper Docker file to make installation easier in the future.
